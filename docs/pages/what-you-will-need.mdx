# What you'll need during the workshop

A modern browser, with access to the Internet to allow you to use the online tools and content that we'll leverage during the workshop.

## Assets, IIIF Manifests and IIIF Collections

Access to assets to use as part of building your own IIIF Manifests and later creating an exhibition with those manifest(s).

Ideally if you have some IIIF resources that you would like to work with that would help - but not essential if you’ve not selected some or don’t yet know what you wish to build.

We have gathered some examples to help inspire, see [Examples of IIIF to explore](/examples-of-iiif-to-explore)

## Tools

### Manifest Editor

The Digirati Manifest Editor is an intuitive editorial interface for IIIF content curation. It has been developed in collaboration with a number of funding partners since 2017, when the first version was developed to support manifest based storytelling narratives and exhibitions for the Victoria and Albert Museum and Technical University of Delft.

More recently user interface enhancements have been developed in collaboration with the Canadian Research Knowledge Network. An updated set of exhibition building features have been developed in collaboration with TU Delft - which will we will explore today. It continues to be enhanced, with a roadmap of new features planned for later in 2025.

It provides comprehensive support for creating and editing IIIF Presentation 3.0 Manifests, with the ability to quickly preview and share work in progress manifests. It can be used standalone or embedded into editorial or digitisation workflows.

### Theseus

Theseus Viewer is a IIIF-compliant, reference viewer that allows users to view, navigate, and interact with digital collections of images, audio, and video, especially in the context of cultural heritage and research applications.​

Theseus is very user friendly, will allow you to share your content with others, and also has wide support for the almost all aspects of the features IIIF provides.

### Universal Viewer

Originally created by Digirati for the Wellcome Library and then extended to cover the British Library’s broad set of use cases as a single ‘Universal Viewer’.
It has established itself as a popular community-driven IIIF viewer used by leading cultural institutions across the world supporting image. audio, video, and pdf as IIIF viewing experiences.

The British Library is now leading further developments of this open source project with their own dedicated team. Recent community sprints have also occurred to help address and enhance accessibility of the tool.

### Exhibition Viewer

A standalone viewer developed by TU Delft and Digirati, originally part of the TUDelft Heritage website and later reorganized into a standalone viewer composed of Open Source IIIF tools. It is fully IIIF-compliant and available as both a standalone package and hosted website. The Exhibition Viewer focuses on curation with the ability to emphasize different canvases and offers more editorial options for creating engaging digital exhibitions.
