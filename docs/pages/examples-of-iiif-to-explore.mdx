# Exploring existing manifests

For IIIF Cloud Services platform users, the ability to import an existing manifest and then edit it within the platform allows them to develop and enhance their existing IIIF as required. This feature also enables users to browse published IIIF Manifests and examine those - perhaps to inform how to structure aspects of the metadata, or see how specific IIIF Presentation specification features have been used by other institutions. 

It is a good way to learn and discover more about the possibilities the specification can afford. So before we start creating our own manifests - we will take a look at one or two so that you can see how they are structured, and view some of the metadata included with them to provide some context for our later work.

Perhaps there are one or more institutions that you are aware of which provide a link to their IIIF Manifests that you would like to select and open? If there are good examples you want to share please do!

:::warning
If you intend to publish your IIIF Manifests ensure you should ensure you have followed the attribution instructions
and include any rights statements and required statements.

## Existing IIIF Collections

You can use Theseus or the Manifest Editor to find IIIF Manifest URLs from existing IIIF collections and Manifests.

### TU Delft

You can navigate their IIIF collection from here: (https://heritage.tudelft.nl/iiif/collection.json )

Using Theseus from the viewer tools, you can navigate through IIIF collections - simply open [Theseus](https://theseusviewer.org/) and paste in the Collection URL.

```
https://theseusviewer.org/?iiif-content={URL}
```

Next to some of the examples there will be links to open and preview IIIF in Theseus.

<TheseusLink href="https://heritage.tudelft.nl/iiif/collection.json" />

You can grab the IIIF Manifest URL from the sidebar.

<img src="/theseus-link-image.jpg" className="w-1/2" alt="The link to open the Manifest in Theseus" />


### Rijksmuseum

The Rijksmuseum has a collection of artworks and artifacts that can be explored. A proxy is
available that allows you to grab IIIF Manifests from the resources. If you paste a URL for
one of these pages in the box below, a IIIF Manifest URL will be generated.

<Rijksmuseum />

:::info
The proxy is available here: https://www.val.town/v/sammeltassen/rijks
:::

https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/10-things/story/10-remarkable-women

Here you can see where to get the URLs from the object pages.

<img src="/rijksmuseum.png" alt="Rijksmuseum" className="w-1/2" />

### Allard Pierson image bank

The Allard Pierson's image bank contains digital images of archaeological objects, paintings, prints, maps, photos and slides, as well as books and manuscripts scanned in their entirety.

The pages on their website contain links to IIIF Manifests that can be browsed in the Manifest Editor Browser.

https://uvaerfgoed.nl/viewer/index/

![University of Amsterdam](/uvaerfgoed.png)

<TheseusLink href="https://uvaerfgoed.nl/viewer/api/v1/records/11245_3_29718/manifest/" label="Open example Manifest" />



### BnF Gallica

An extensive resource - you can explore by Topic (https://gallica.bnf.fr/accueil/en/html/accueil-en) to find some content that may be of interest across a range of areas. Selecting a topic (Geography and Maps for example): https://gallica.bnf.fr/selections/fr/html/geographie-et-cartographie, you can navigate to content such as https://gallica.bnf.fr/selections/fr/html/images/photographies-de-la-societe-de-geographie-acces-geographique

Selecting an object from the search results, viewing it in their viewer, you can find the IIIF Manifest link:

i.e. https://gallica.bnf.fr/iiif/ark:/12148/btv1b8492135q/manifest.json

### WikiData

As mentioned on the IIIF Guides, Wikidata has a property for IIIF Manifests which enables queries to be created that filter and retrieve manifests if they match other Wikidata properties. You can use the examples listed here: https://iiif.io/guides/guides/www.wikidata.org/ which generate links to the manifest using the Mirador viewer.

There is also an example configured for Theseus here: https://w.wiki/DaXE

### Wellcome

The Wellcome Collection has various IIIF endpoints available to browse through from their archives.

<TheseusLink
  href="https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/presentation/v3/collections/archives"
  label="Wellcome Collection"
/>

### Northwestern University Libraries

The Digital collections at Northwestern University Libraries are available online as a IIIF Collection that
you can browse through.

https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections?as=iiif

<TheseusLink
  href="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections?as=iiif"
  label="Northwestern University Libraries"
/>

## IIIF Image Services

From the Manifest Editor you can add IIIF-enabled images from their `info.json` manifest links. These enable deep zoom
for the images. Some providers do not support IIIF Presentation APIs (Collections and Manifests) but do offer API endpoints for their images.

![](./add-image-service.jpg)

### NLS collection

One provider that supports IIIF Images is the National Library of Scotland Map Collection.

https://maps.nls.uk/

![](./nls-maps.jpg)

From their site, if you are looking at a single map you can click on the "Show IIIF" and grab a link to the `info.json` link to add it to your Manifest.

## Static images

You can also add images using images that are not IIIF-enabled. You will need an image that is allowed to be linked
to from other pages. The format also needs to be supported by browsers, so formats such as JP2000 may not work correctly.

![](./image-from-url.jpg)

There are a few sources where you can find some static images to include in your Manifests.

### The CDLI Collection

On this CDLI collection website high-resolution images are available of the tablets.

https://cdli.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/

> By making the form and content of cuneiform texts available online, the CDLI is opening pathways to the rich historical tradition of the ancient Middle East. In close collaboration with researchers, museums and an engaged public, the project seeks to unharness the extraordinary content of these earliest witnesses to our shared world heritage.

An example image:

### Nasa Images

Generate a IIIF Collection using a search term from the NASA photo archive.

<NasaProxy />

:::info
You can paste the URL of this collection into the IIIF Browser in the Manifest Editor.
