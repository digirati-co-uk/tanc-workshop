# Creating your own IIIF Manifests

Using the 'Create new manifest' in the Manifest Editor will navigate you to an empty Manifest where you can begin to add your content.

We will discuss the types of content you may wish to add and we can answer any questions you have on these.

One more detailed example that we will highlight is the addition of multiple images to a single canvas.

## Multi-image canvas

You may want to add multiple image(s) to a canvas as part of your manifest for exhibition display. This could be a collection of pages from a book or paper or a series of images.

To create this, select the ‘Add canvas’ option in the left hand panel, and then select to add an “Empty canvas”:

Click on the canvas in the left hand panel. Add a label to your canvas using the right hand side metadata panel. 

To add the first image, click the ‘+ Add media’ option in the right hand side Canvas metadata tab:

Select the first image you wish to add, using the appropriate image option. Once you have selected the image, it will be loaded into the Canvas, using the whole canvas area as below:

In the right hand metadata panel for the newly added image, scroll to find the ‘Target’ for the selected image:

Select the ‘Change’ option, to enable you to position the selected image on the canvas as required. Clicking the pencil icon, as highlighted below, will enable you to move and resize the selected image:

Once you have positioned and resized your image as desired, you can select to ‘Finish editing’ . You can then either click on the Canvas label in the left hand panel, or use the ‘Back’ arrow in the right hand panel to return to the Canvas:

To add another image to the Canvas, click on the ‘+ Add media’ option, and select the image you want to add, using the appropriate option. In the example below, an IIIF Image service image is selected for addition to the canvas:

Repeating the steps above, you can use the pencil icon to enable you to resize and move the selected image as required.

You can validate that the images have been correctly added, and positioned appropriately for your canvas by using the ‘Preview’ option, selecting Theseus to view your manifest.
