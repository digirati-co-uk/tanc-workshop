# Get started

To get started, navigate to the IIIF Manifest Editor (https://manifest-editor.digirati.services/)

![Landing page for Manifest Editor](https://digirati-workshops.pages.dev/open-manifest-editor.PNG)

If you have not accessed the Manifest Editor recently, you will be directed to the 'Examples' tab, where you can click on and open a number of example Manifests from different institutes. These are presented as readonly previews, but you can still explore the metadata in each.

The ability to import an existing manifest and then edit it within the Manifest Editor allows users to develop and enhance their existing IIIF as required. This feature also enables users to browse published IIIF Manifests and examine those - perhaps to inform how to structure aspects of the metadata, or see how specific IIIF Presentation specification features have been used by other institutions. 

It is a good way to learn and discover more about the possibilities the specification can afford. So before we start creating our own manifests later in the workshop - letâ€™s take a look at one or two manifests so that you can see how they are structured, and view some of the metadata included with them to provide some context for our later work.

You can find a selection of IIIF content to explore in [Examples of IIIF to explore](/examples-of-iiif-to-explore)

Once you have found a IIIF Manifest URL to open, click the 'Open manifest URL' and paste in the URL:

You can also use the IIIF Collection(s) URLs as a starting point to find a manifest of interest; click on the 'Browse for IIIF' option, and paste the URL of a IIIF Collection, which you can then open and browse to find a manifest.

Alternatively, if you have a IIIF Manifest file on your machine, use the 'Open manifest file' option to browse and find the manifest.

Once you have found and opened one or two manifests, we will discuss some of the IIIF elements and Manifest Editor features to help orientate participants before we embark on creating our own manifests!
