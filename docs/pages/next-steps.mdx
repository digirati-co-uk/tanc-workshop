# Next steps

We hope that the workshop today has been useful, and has given you some of the basics you'll need to help you progress with your use cases for IIIF.

## Your TaNC Sandbox account

The sandbox you've been given access to today will be available for 6 months. You can use the sandbox to experiment and test creation and publication of IIIF content. After the six months, the accounts will be disabled and the content deleted.

Please refer to the [Terms and Conditions](https://iiif-cloud.digirati.com/terms-and-conditions) which apply to your sandbox account; continued use of the sandbox after the workshop constitutes your acceptance of these terms.

## Going further with IIIF

There are a number of great online resources to enable you to learn more about IIIF in your own time or as part of an expert-led training course. The IIIF Consortium’s online training is a great place to start - and if you want to try going further today with any area you can refer to their course syllabus here: https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/index.html.

### IIIF Conference - Leeds

> The 2025 International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Annual Conference will be held in Leeds, UK June 2–5, 2025, and will be hosted jointly by the University of Leeds and the IIIF Consortium. This event is intended for a wide range of participants and interested parties, including digital image repository managers, content curators, software developers, scholars, and administrators at libraries, museums, cultural heritage institutions, software firms, and other organizations working with digital images and audio/visual materials. In addition to the Conference, held June 3 and 4, the event includes a free Showcase on June 2. The Showcase is meant to introduce newcomers to IIIF, and those seeking to learn how IIIF is used in a variety of contexts. The conference features plenary presentations and sessions about IIIF implementations around the world, including cutting edge use cases and demonstrations.

### TaNC Materials relating to IIIF

A report on the Practical applications of IIIF as a building block towards a digital National Collection was completed during the TaNC's work:

> This project explored and demonstrated some of the possibilities of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) to support the dissemination of born digital and digitised heritage images for research and engagement. IIIF, along with a wide range of freely available IIIF compliant software, represents a flexible, standard approach to providing reliable access to such images.

See the website and resources developed here for more examples and insight: https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/IIIF-TNC/home.html

### Exhibition building workshop

Digirati will be running a workshop in the coming months, focussing on using IIIF Manifests as the basis for Exhibition building. This workshop help participants create their own IIIF Manifests for exhibits, and then use open source IIIF tools to create exhibitions that can exhibit the content.

If you are interested in participating in that event, please drop an email to contact@digirati.com and we'll keep you updated on the event timing.

### The IIIF Cookbook

IIIF Canvas be used to represent a variety of digital objects. We've covered some of the building blocks required in this workshop, but you can delve further into different applications of IIIF in the real world through the examples written and curated by the IIIF Community in the Cookbook.

The use cases range from basic representations of different types of material (e.g. Newspapers, Books, AV) to more advanced uses cases with annotations, book chapters, AV captions and subtitles.
