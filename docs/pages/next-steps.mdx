# Next steps

We hope that the workshop today has been useful, and has given you some of the basics you'll need to help you progress with your use cases for IIIF. 

## Your TaNC Sandbox account

The sandbox you've been given access to today will be available for 6 months. You can use the sandbox to experiment and test creation and publication of IIIF content. After the six months, the accounts will be disabled and the content deleted.

Please refer to the [Terms and Conditions](https://iiif-cloud.digirati.com/terms-and-conditions) which apply to your sandbox account; continued use of the sandbox after the workshop constitutes your acceptance of these terms.


## Going further with IIIF 

There are a number of great online resources to enable you to learn more about IIIF in your own time or as part of an expert-led training course. The IIIF Consortium’s online training is a great place to start - and if you want to try going further today with any area you can refer to their course syllabus here: https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/index.html.
