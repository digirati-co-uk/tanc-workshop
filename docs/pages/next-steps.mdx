# Next steps

We hope that the workshop today has been useful, and has given you some of the basics you'll need to help you progress with your use cases for IIIF. 

## Your TaNC Sandbox account

The sandbox you've been given access to today will be available for 6 months. You can use the sandbox to experiment and test creation and publication of IIIF content. After the six months, the accounts will be disabled and the content deleted.
