# Uploading images to your Sandbox environment

The first aspect we’ll focus on, is taking an image and making it available as a IIIF Image. To do this, we will leverage the IIIF Cloud Service which can ingest an image and create the necessary IIIF Image API endpoints and derivatives.

If you have one or more images (or you want to take a photo of something you wish to digitise) on your laptop that you wish to use, we will guide you through that process.

## Uploading your own image

In your browser, from the IIIF CS portal homepage, navigate to the Spaces area. This is where digital assets are stored and managed.
